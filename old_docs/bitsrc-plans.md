Bit provides free hosting for open source projects. To host private code, Bit provide a variety of plans for your team and organization.

## Bit Plans

Bit offers several billing plans. A billing plan is a Bit Organization subscription and does not require a developer to purchase a subscription to use Bit. Furthermore, developers can collaborate in any number of organizations.

* **Community plan** - The basic subscription plan in Bit. This plan is active for all registered users.  The Community plan allows every developer to start working with Bit, and use it for their public and private projects, as it includes a limited amount of private Collections.
* **Team plan** - This subscription allows organizations to collaborate on an unlimited amount of private code. The plan includes a premium support model and can be purchased only if you have created an organization in Bit.
* **Business plan** - The business subscription plan is aimed at larger teams and organizations with a need for improved support and SLA.

## Plan cancellation, issues, and limits

You can cancel your plan and stop your recurring payments, at any time.

### Canceling a plan

When you cancel a subscription, you retain access to all private Collections and components and to all of your plan features, until the end of the current billing cycle. After that, the Community plan takes affect, and you will no longer be able to access your private Collections or create new ones for your organization.

> **Canceling a plan does NOT delete private Collections.**

### Reactivate a canceled plan

Reactivating a subscription will renew the monthly subscription fee. If the account had private Collections, you would regain access to them immediately.

### Recurring charge issues

If there is an issue charging the payment method, your account will retain a 60 days grace period, in which all account members will still have access to premium features and private code components.
If the issue was not resolved by the end of the grace period, all access to premium features and private Collections is removed from the organization account.
