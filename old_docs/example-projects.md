We've created a few tutorials and example projects that will help you learn how to use bit (don't forget to take a look at each project's `readme` file on [GitHub](github.com)).  

* [React Application](https://github.com/teambit/movie-app) with UI components, and a [matching Collection](https://bit.dev/bit/movie-app) of components shared from this App with Bit.
* Tutorial to walk you through [sharing components directly from a React application](/tutorial/react-app-tutorial.html) to other projects.
* Tutorial to walk you through [splitting a shared library of React components](/tutorial/react-tutorial.html) to individual components.
* Tutorial to walk you through [splitting a shared library of Node JS modules](/tutorial/node-tutorial.html) to individual components.

Bit does not require you to modify your project and codebase. So itâ€™s easy for you to follow both tutorials with your project.
